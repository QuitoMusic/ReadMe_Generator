## Description

This project was created as a tool deployed from the local command-line and it's designed to simplify the process of creating a professional ReadMe file. It automates the generation of templates, allowing developers to focus on the actual content of their projects.

## Installation

First, search for repository on Github called ReadMe_Generator. Then, on the top-right corner, click 'Code' and copy the link. Afterwards, go to VSCode and open the local terminal from the desired parent repostory where you desire to install the generator code. Then, write 'git clone (paste link here)'. Finally, you'll notice the repository has been installed for your convenience. Before making any changes, make sure that the propper dependencies have been downloaded to prevent bugs or functionality issues.   

## Usage

Write 'node index.js' on the terminal. Answer all prompts. After all answers have been submitted a message calling for a ReadMe file creation appears and now, the file will be added to your parent repository. Customize afterwards with your desired requirements for individual projects.
